Arrays are:

collection of items. we can store primitive and non primitive data inside arrays

why we need it?
 help us manage large data stored in arrays using loops
 we can process data using loops

 // i is the variable name of index
         //index is always integer

 /* instead of using
 System.out.println(n[0]);
         System.out.println(n[1]);
         System.out.println(n[2]);
         System.out.println(n[3]);
         System.out.println(n[4]);
         System.out.println(n[5]);
  */

  / if don't wanna count how many index, java can do that with syntax
